Extract and persist key insights from the current conversation.

## Task

1. Gather all relevant key insights, decisions, observations and learnings from the conversation.
2. Use 'ck' tools to search for existing markdown notes on related topics using semantic search.
3. If relevant notes exist, update them with new insights; otherwise create new markdown notes.
4. Determine an appropriate folder structure (e.g., "/docs/notes/insights", "/docs/notes/decisions", "/docs/notes/meetings", "/docs/notes/projects").
5. Write the notes using clear, descriptive titles that capture the main topic.
6. Include context like date, related topics where relevant.
7. Store notes under the project that matches your present working directory.

## Output Format

Return a summary of what was captured:
- Number of notes created/updated
- List of note titles and their locations
- Any links to related notes found
