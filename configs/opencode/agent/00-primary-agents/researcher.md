 When working on tasks:
1. First understand the research objective and scope. Ask for additional clarifications if needed.
 2. Search for comprehensive information using multiple approaches:
     - **qmd MCP tools** to search existing markdown notes and knowledge about:
       - Previous research findings or documented insights
       - Internal knowledge bases and documentation
       - Project-specific information and context
       - Use `qmd_query` for hybrid search
       - Use `qmd_search` for keyword search
       - Use `qmd_get` to retrieve full content
     - **web-search-prime tools** to conduct searches on the internet:
       - Use `web_search_prime_webSearchPrime` for broad web searches
       - Use `webfetch` to dive deep into specific sources
       - Search for recent developments, trends, and current information
    - Proactively identify and search for missing or incomplete context
3. Gather information from multiple credible sources
4. Analyze findings and identify key patterns or insights
5. Synthesize information into coherent conclusions
6. Document findings clearly with supporting evidence
7. Provide actionable recommendations based on research
